## Summary

## Methodology

This analysis is intended to adhere to the guidance proposed by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Association (NOAA) in its September 2020 technical memorandum *Coral Reef Restoration Monitoring Guide: Methods to Evaluate Restoration Success From Local Ecosystem Scales.* All data was provided by RRB.  The ecological footprint data was collected from photomosaics and traditional underwater surveying methods.  The site-specific data was provided after detailed surveys of the outplanted sites.  

Coral cover percentage is calculated as (total coral area / eco-footprint) * 100.

Mortality rates are a standard calculation of (corals present - dead corals) / corals outplanted.

Average tissue health is calculated as a weighted average of five tissue-health categories.  Corals are partitioned into tissue health groups of 1-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-99%, and 100%.  The central point of each category (12.5%, 37.5%, 62.5%, 87%, and 100%) is used to calculate the average tissue health.  This calculation does not include dead observations or those with 0% tissue health.[^1]

All calculations and visualizations are performed using R.  R packages for this project include *knitr*, *readxl*, *tidyverse*, *plotly*, *flextable*, and *PortfolioAnalytics*.  The report is formatted in Markdown, and all versions have been pushed to a GitHub repository.

## Overview of Restoration Efforts

```{r, foramtting Ltsummary}
### Removing NAs  
ltsummary <- ltsummary %>% select(-subsite) %>% drop_na(eco_footprint)

```

The following visuals highlight the changes in ecological footprints and total coral coverage from year to year.  Data from RRB's long-term surveys was used for this section.  As new outplanting sites are created each year, not all sites have been surveyed equally.  

```{r ecological footprint}

eco_summary %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~eco_footprint, color = ~site_name,
          mode = "lines+markers",
          hoverinfo = "text",
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site_name, "<br>",
                         "Year: ", year, "<br>",
                         "Eco-footprint: ", eco_footprint)) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Eco-Footprint (m)"),
         title = "Change in Ecological Footprint Over Time")

eco_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = eco_footprint)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~site_name) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Eco-Footprint (m)",
       title = "Change in Eco-Footrpint by Site")

```


In the visual below, I have plotted the change in Coral Cover as a percentage over time and by site.  As previously noted, this calculation is the total area of coral cover / the size of the eco-footprint.  It represents the density of coral coverage for a given site.

```{r, eco growth by metric, message=FALSE}

ltsummary %>%
  mutate(coral_cover = (tot_coral_area / eco_footprint)*100) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~survey_date, y = ~coral_cover, color = ~site_name, mode = "lines+markers",
          hoverinfo = "text",
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site_name, "<br>",
                         "Year: ", year(survey_date), "<br>",
                         "Coral Cover: ", round(coral_cover,2), "%")) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Coral Cover (%)"),
         title = "Change in Coral Cover Over Time")

```


## Species: Acer

The Acer species, commonly known as Staghorn Coral, has been outplanted at the following sites: Mi Dushi I, Punt Vierkant, and Yellowman (subsites A-C).  

The Acer data consists of survey from five sites: Mi Dushi, Punt Vierkant, Yellowman A, B, and C.  The Mi Dushi survey was taken 13 months after outplanting.  Data was provided from three- and six-month surveys for Punt VierKant, Yellowman A, and B.  All data utilized from Yellowman C is from a three-month survey.

<br>

```{r combining acer sites}
# Aligning class types
puntv3$cluster <- str_remove_all(puntv3$cluster, "C") %>% as.numeric()
puntv6$cluster <- str_remove_all(puntv6$cluster, "C") %>% as.numeric()
yellowmanA3$date <- as.POSIXct(yellowmanA3$date)
yellowmanA3$cluster <- str_remove_all(yellowmanA3$cluster, "C") %>% as.numeric()
yellowmanA6$cluster <- str_remove_all(yellowmanA6$cluster, "C") %>% as.numeric()
yellowmanB3$date <- as.POSIXct(yellowmanB3$date)
yellowmanB3$cluster <- str_remove_all(yellowmanB3$cluster, "C") %>% as.numeric()

# Binding acer rows.
acer_all <- bind_rows(midushi13, puntv3, puntv6, yellowmanA3, yellowmanA6,
                      yellowmanB3, yellowmanB6, yellowmanC3) %>%
            arrange(date)

# Changing duration to numeric.
acer_all$duration <- acer_all$duration %>% str_remove_all("M") %>% as.numeric()

```

### Acer Summary

Below is a distribution of survey data collected by site and survey time since outplanting.


```{r plotting distribution of acer_all data}

acer_all %>%
  group_by(species, site, duration) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=site, fill = factor(duration))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired", direction = -1) +
  labs(x = "Site",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Survey Month",
       title="Distribution of acer Data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<br>

The table below lists summary statistics for each Acer site.

<br>

```{r acer mortality by site}

acer_latest <- acer_all %>%
  group_by(species, site) %>%
  filter(duration == max(duration))

acer_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(species, site) %>%
   summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
              num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
              mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
              avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mortality_rate)) %>%
  rename("Site" = site) %>%
  table_format()
  
```

<br>

### Acer Mortality Rates

The plots below highlight differences on the genomic level.  Data was utilized from each site.  When multiple surveys were provided for a site, the latest (most recent) data was used.  Specifically, the three-month surveys for Punt Vierkant, Yellowman A, and Yellowman B were omited in favor of using the six-month survey data.  The result is a snap shot of current conditions.

Genos #3, #9, #14, and #22 have the highest mortality rates.  This corresponds with the average tissue health, indicating these are perhaps the least successful genos.  Conversely, genos #7-8, #12, #24, and #26 have performed better than the rest.  

<br>

```{r plotting acer_all data}

# Mortality plot.
acer_mortality.plot <- acer_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  agg_table() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(geno), y = mortality_rate, fill = mortality_rate)) +
  geom_col(aes(text= paste0("Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate,2), "%"))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent_format(scale=1)) +
  labs(x="Genotype", 
       y="Mortality Rate",
       fill="Genotype") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = FALSE, option = "turbo") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(fill = "Mortality Rate",
       title = "Acer Mortality Rate",
        caption = "As of latest site survey.") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplotly(acer_mortality.plot, tooltip = "text")

```

<br>

Below, I isolated the data to site with both three- and six-month surveys (Punt Vierkant, Yellowman A, and Yellowman B) and plotted the change in mortality rate over time.  The data indicates that while a three-month survey may be reasonable for obtaining a baseline of outplanting success for some genos, others (#9, #14, #22, and #25 for example) may take longer to fully establish.

<br>

```{r acer 3- to 6-month mortality}
comparison_sites <- c("Punt Vierkant", "Yellowman A", "Yellowman B")

acer_comp1 <- acer_all %>%
  filter(site %in% comparison_sites) %>% 
  group_by(species, duration, geno) %>%
  summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100)

acer_comp2 <- acer_comp1 %>% filter(duration == 3)

acer_comp2 %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), 
          y = ~mortality_rate, 
          hoverinfo = "text", 
          hovertext = ~paste0("Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate,2), "%")) %>%
  add_markers(marker = list(color = toRGB("gray15"), size = 5)) %>%
  add_bars(data = acer_comp1, color = ~factor(geno), frame = ~duration) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Acer Genotype"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Mortality Rate"),
         title = "How Does Mortality Rate Change Over 3 Months?",
          plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke") %>%
  animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "Survey Month: ")) %>%
  hide_legend()
  
```

<br>

Separating the mortality rate findings by site reveals which site have performed better than others.  That said, it is important to note that not all sites contain all genos.  Hence, site statistics may be unfairly skewed by a greater number of poorly performing genos as the they cannot be held equal.

            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
            avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(mortality_rate) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), 
          y = ~mortality_rate, 
          color = ~site, 
          hoverinfo = "text", 
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site, "<br>",
                         "Geno: ",geno, "<br>", 
                         "Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate, 2), "%")) %>%
    add_bars(width = 0.5, position = "jitter") %>%
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Acer Genotype"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Mortality Rate"),
           title = "Acer Mortality Rate by Site",
           legend = list(x=1, y=.5, title = list(text = "Site")),
            plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke")

```

<br>

### Acer Tissue Health

The average tissue health for each geno is generally in line with the mortality rates.  Genos #9, #14, and #22 have not performed as well as others in either measure.  It is worth noting that genos #3 and #6 (each with higher mortality rates) have good average tissue health once a few low outliers are omitted.

<br>

```{r acer tissue health by geno}

acer_health.plot <- acer_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  mutate(med_tissue = median(weighted_health))

plot_ly(acer_health.plot, 
        x = ~factor(geno),
        y = ~weighted_health) %>%
  add_boxplot() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Acer Genotype"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Acer Average Tissue Health"),
         title = "Acer Average Tissue Health") %>%
  hide_legend()

```

<br>

The graph below is a raw breakdown of average tissue health by geno and by site.  Each recorded observation is plotted.  Filtering the data to view individual sites helps to identify the distribution of observations by geno.

<br>
*Note: clicking on the legend names allows you to filter the chart.*

<br>

```{r acer tissue health by site}

acer_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno),
          y = ~weighted_health,
          color = ~site,
          hoverinfo = "text",
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site, "<br>",
                         "Geno: ", geno,  "<br>",
                         "Tissue Health: ", round(weighted_health, 2), "%")) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Acer Genotype<br>"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Percent of Healthy Tissue"),
         title = "Acer Tissue Health by Site",
         legend = list(x=1, y=.5, title = list(text = "Site")),
         plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke")

```

<br>

A negative correlation between mortality rate and tissue health exists.  The linear regression line below highlights the relationship.  I use an ANOVA test to confirm the model is statistically significant. 

<br>

```{r acer mortality vs tissue health}

acer4model <- acer_all %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(species, site, geno, duration) %>%
  summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
            avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(mortality_rate) 

print(paste0("The correlation between mortality rate and tissue health is ", round(cor(acer4model$mortality_rate, acer4model$avg_health),3), "."))
             
acermod <- lm(mortality_rate ~ avg_health, data = acer4model)
acermod
anova(acermod)

ggplot(acer4model, aes(x = mortality_rate, y = avg_health)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = site, color = site)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm, color = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(x = "Mortality Rate",
         y = "Average Tissue Health",
         color = "Site",
         shape = "Site",
         title = "Acer Tissue Health vs. Mortality Rate") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
<br>

### Acer Portfolio Analysis
<br>

The goals are Reef Renewal Bonaire are to successfully outplant as many corals as possible but also to ensure new reefs are genomicaly diverse.  Thus, the driving question is how to achieve both goals with maximial efficiency of time and resources.  One strategy could be to plant an equal number of each genotype; however, the data shows that not all genotypes are equally resilient.  As a result, I propose building a weighted portfolio of genotypes in the same manor as one might build a financial portfolio of investments.

In typical portfolio analysis, the primary factors of consideration are the return on investment for each account and the standard distribution of returns (risk).  From these factors, an optimal basket of accounts is selected to achieve the desired portfolio goals.  In a portfolio of genotypes, I propose using the inverse mortality rate as the return on investment.  For example, geno #1 has an average mortality rate of 3.11%; therefore, a 96.89% survival rate (return on investment).  Similarly, geno #3 has a 21.54% average mortality rate and so there is a 78.46% average return.  The standard deviation of returns is then calculated for each genomic group of observations as a measure of risk.

Having a sufficiently large sample size to calculate accurate returns and standard deviations is important.  Below, I have plotted the distribution of observations to visualize the raw sample size of each genotype.  

<br>

```{r acer creating portfolio}
# Creating tidy acer portfolio.
acer.port <- acer_all %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  mutate(mortality_rate = (n_outplanted-(n_present - health_0)) / n_outplanted,
         returns = 1 - mortality_rate) %>% 
  select(geno, weighted_health, mortality_rate, returns)

acer.port$mortality_rate <- replace_na(acer.port$mortality_rate, 0)
acer.port$returns <- replace_na(acer.port$returns, 1) 

# Reviewing distribution of data.
acer.port %>% 
  count(geno) %>%
  mutate(percent = paste0(round(100 * n / sum(n),2),"%")) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), y = ~n, hoverinfo = "text",
          hovertext = ~paste0("Observations: ", n, "<br>",
                          "Percent of Total: ", percent, "%", "<br>")) %>%
  add_bars() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Acer Genotypes"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Observations"),
        title = "Distribution of Observations") %>%
  hide_legend()


# Creating aggregate portfolio by geno.
acer.port.agg <- acer.port %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarize(avg_health = mean(weighted_health),
            avg_mortality = mean(mortality_rate),
            avg_returns = mean(returns),
            sd = sd(returns),
            observations = n())

```

<br>

Additionally, the chart below shows the relationship between average return and standard deviation.

<br>

```{r acer portolio return vs sd }

plot_ly(acer.port.agg, x = ~sd, 
                      y = ~avg_returns,

# acer.port %>% ggplot(aes(x = returns)) + geom_histogram() + facet_trelliscope(~geno)

```

#### Acer Bootstrapping

Because the sample size of some genotypes is limited, I use bootstrapping to artificially expand the sample size.  Each entire genotype group is randomly sampled 1000 times with replacement.  The result is a larger sample of the original data.  Through the Central Limit Theorem, the bootstrapped data approaches a more normal distribution.  Thus, the average returns closely resemble the sample means, but the risk factors (standard deviations) used for portfolio analysis are more closely representative of the population.

<br>

```{r acer bootstrapping portfolio}

# Creating bootstrap data set.
acer.boot <- replicate(n = 1000, simplify = FALSE, expr = {
  acer.port %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 1, replace = TRUE)
 }) %>%
  bind_rows()

# Summarizing bootstrapped data by geno.
acer.boot.agg <- acer.boot %>%
  summarize(avg_health = mean(weighted_health),
         avg_mortality = mean(mortality_rate),
         avg_returns = mean(returns),
         sd = sd(returns),
         observations = n())

```


**Summary of Raw Data**
```{r acer portfolio raw table}
# Raw data summary
print(summary(acer.port.agg[,4:6]))

```

**Summary of Bootstrapped Data**
```{r acer portfolio bootstrap table}

# Boostrapped data summary
summary(acer.boot.agg[,4:6])

# Checking for normal distribution.
#acer.boot %>% ggplot(aes(x = returns)) + geom_histogram() + facet_trelliscope(~geno)
  
```
<br>
#### Acer Portfolio

Finally, the Portfolio Analytics' *optimize.portfolio* function is used on the bootstrapped data set to calculate the optimal weights of each genotype in the portfolio.  Portfolio specifications are added to ensure that 1)the portfolio is fully invested, long-only, where the sum of weights total to 1.0 (or 100%), 2)returns are defined as the mean survival rate and risk is defined as the standard deviation of the means, and 3)each genotype makes up a minimum of 1% of the total portfolio and a maximum of 40%.
<br>
The outputs below identify the optimal weights for each genotype and the anticipated portfolio return and risk.  Additionally, the graph plots the optimal portfolio against all other iterations the model considered.  

<br>

```{r acer portfolio analysis}

acer.returns.wide <- acer.boot %>%
  select(geno, returns) %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = geno, values_from = returns) %>%
  select(-row)

acer.returns.wide <- as.ts(acer.returns.wide)
port_spec <- portfolio.spec(assets = colnames(acer.returns.wide))
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "full_investment")
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "long_only")
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "return", name = "mean")
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "risk", name = "StdDev")
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "box",
                                  min = 0.01, max = 0.25, 
                                  indexnum = 2)

set.seed(2)
acer.opt <- optimize.portfolio(acer.returns.wide,
                          portfolio = port_spec,
                          optimize_method = "random",
                          search_size = 20000,
                          trace = TRUE)

chart.RiskReward(acer.opt, risk.col = "StdDev", return.col = "mean", chart.assets = FALSE,
                 main = "Optimal Acer Portfolio")

```

<br>

## Species: Apal


The Apal speices, commonly known as Elkhorn coral, has been outplanted at the following sites: Carl's Hill, Knife I (subsites A-C), Oil Slick Leap, and South Bay II.

The Carl's Hill, Knife IB, and Knife IC surveys were taken three- and six-months after outplanting.  Data was provided from one-, five, and six-month surveys for Knife IA.  Data from Oil Slick Leap was collected one-, seven-, and 13-months after outplanting, and the Southbay II data was collected at a half-month and 18 months from outplanting.

<br>

```{r combining apal sites}

apal_all$duration <- apal_all$duration %>% str_remove_all("M") %>% as.numeric()

```

### Apal Summary

Below highlights the distribution of data collected.
<br>

```{r plotting distribution of apal_all data}

apal_all %>%
  group_by(species, site, duration) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=site, fill = factor(duration))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(x = "Site",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Survey Month",
       title="Distribution of Apal Data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<br>

The table below lists summary statistics for each Apal site.

<br>

```{r apal mortality by site}

apal_latest <- apal_all %>%
  group_by(species, site) %>%
  filter(duration == max(duration))

apal_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(species, site) %>%
   summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
              num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
              mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
              avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mortality_rate)) %>%
  rename("Site" = site) %>%
  table_format()

```

<br>

### Apal Mortality Rate

The plots below highlight differences on the genomic level.  As with the Acer data, when multiple surveys were provided for a site, the latest (most recent) data was used.  

Genos #16, #17, and #22 have the highest mortality rates.  Unlike the Acer date, these genos do not  correspond with the average tissue health statistics. Conversely, genos #9-10, and #13 have performed better than the rest.  

<br>

```{r plotting apal_all data}

# Mortality plot.
apal_mortality.plot <- apal_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  agg_table() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(geno), y = mortality_rate, fill = mortality_rate)) +
  geom_col(aes(text= paste0("Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate,2), "%"))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent_format(scale=1)) +
  labs(x="Genotype", 
       y="Mortality Rate",
       fill="Genotype") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = FALSE, option = "turbo") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(fill = "Mortality Rate",
       title = "Apal Mortality Rate",
        caption = "As of latest site survey.") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplotly(apal_mortality.plot, tooltip = "text")

```

<br>
As with the Acer data, I filtered the Apal data to sites with both three- and six-month surveys (Carl's Hill, Knife IB and Knife IC) and plotted the change in mortality rate over time.  

It should be noted that instances in which mortality decreased also correspond with a decrease in sample size.  For example, the three-month surveys of geno #23 shows a total of 20 outplanted observations; however the six-month surveys show a total of only 10 outplanted observations.  It appears that not all clusters were re-surveyed.

<br>

```{r apal 3- to 6-month mortality}

apal_durations <- c(3, 6)

apal_comp1 <- apal_all %>%
  filter(duration %in% apal_durations) %>%
  group_by(species, duration, geno) %>%
  summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100)

apal_comp2 <- apal_comp1 %>% filter(duration == 3)

apal_comp2 %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), 
          y = ~mortality_rate, 
          hoverinfo = "text", 
          hovertext = ~paste0("Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate,2), "%")) %>%
  add_markers(marker = list(color = toRGB("gray15"), size = 5)) %>%
  add_bars(data = apal_comp1, color = ~factor(geno), frame = ~duration) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Apal Genotype"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Mortality Rate"),
         title = "How Does Mortality Rate Change Over 3 Months?",
          plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke") %>%
  animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "Survey Month: ")) %>%
  hide_legend()

```

<br>

Separating the mortality rate findings by site reveals which site have performed better than others.  Genos #6-11 have more stable mortality rates across site than, say, genos #2, 19, and 22.

<br>

<br>

```{r apal mortality by geno and site}

apal_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(species, site, geno) %>%
  summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
            avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(mortality_rate) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), 
          y = ~mortality_rate, 
          color = ~site, 
          hoverinfo = "text", 
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site, "<br>",
                         "Geno: ",geno, "<br>", 
                         "Mortality Rate: ", round(mortality_rate, 2), "%")) %>%
    add_bars(width = 0.5, position = "jitter") %>%
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Apal Genotype"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Mortality Rate"),
           title = "Apal Mortality Rate by Site",
           legend = list(x=1, y=.5, title = list(text = "Site")),
            plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke")

```

<br>


<br>

```{r apal tissue health by geno}

apal_health.plot <- apal_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  mutate(med_tissue = median(weighted_health))

plot_ly(apal_health.plot, 
        x = ~factor(geno),
        y = ~weighted_health) %>%
  add_boxplot() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Apal Genotype"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Apal Average Tissue Health"),
         title = "Apal Average Tissue Health") %>%
  hide_legend()

```

<br>

Filtering the breakdown of average tissue health by geno and by site helps to identify the distribution of observations by geno.  Oil Slick Leap has the most healthy distribution of corals, while Carl's Hill and Knife A appear more widely distributed.
<br>
*Note: clicking on the legend names allows you to filter the chart.*

<br>

```{r apal tissue health by site}

apal_latest %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno),
          y = ~weighted_health,
          color = ~site,
          hoverinfo = "text",
          text = ~paste0("Site: ", site, "<br>",
                         "Geno: ", geno,  "<br>",
                         "Tissue Health: ", round(weighted_health, 2), "%")) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Apal Genotype<br>"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Percent of Healthy Tissue"),
         title = "Apal Tissue Health by Site",
         legend = list(x=1, y=.5, title = list(text = "Site")),
         plot_bgcolor = "whitesmoke")

```

<br>

As with the Acer data, a negative correlation between mortality rate and tissue health exists.  The linear regression line highlights the relationship. Again, I use an ANOVA test to confirm the model is statistically significant. 

<br>

```{r apal mortality vs tissue health}

apal4model <- apal_all %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  group_by(species, site, geno, duration) %>%
  summarize(num_outplanted = sum(n_outplanted),
            num_survived = sum(n_present, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(health_0, na.rm=TRUE),
            mortality_rate = 100 - sum(num_survived / num_outplanted)*100,
            avg_health = mean(weighted_health)) %>%
  arrange(mortality_rate) 

print(paste0("The correlation between mortality rate and tissue health is ", round(cor(apal4model$mortality_rate, apal4model$avg_health),3), "."))
             
apalmod <- lm(mortality_rate ~ avg_health, data = apal4model)
apalmod
anova(apalmod)

ggplot(apal4model, aes(x = mortality_rate, y = avg_health)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = site, color = site)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm, color = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(x = "Mortality Rate",
         y = "Average Tissue Health",
         color = "Site",
         shape = "Site",
         title = "Apal Tissue Health vs. Mortality Rate") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
<br>

### Apal Portfolio Analysis
<br>

The process to model the Apal portfolio is the same as for the Acer species.  The raw data is reviewed, bootstrapped, and modeled with the same portfolio weight requirements.

<br>

```{r apal creating portfolio}
# Creating tidy apal portfolio.
apal.port <- apal_all %>%
  tissue_health() %>%
  mutate(mortality_rate = (n_outplanted-(n_present - health_0)) / n_outplanted,
         returns = 1 - mortality_rate) %>% 
  select(geno, weighted_health, mortality_rate, returns)

apal.port$mortality_rate <- replace_na(apal.port$mortality_rate, 0)
apal.port$returns <- replace_na(apal.port$returns, 1) 

# Reviewing distribution of data.
apal.port %>% 
  count(geno) %>%
  mutate(percent = paste0(round(100 * n / sum(n),2),"%")) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~factor(geno), y = ~n, hoverinfo = "text",
          hovertext = ~paste0("Observations: ", n, "<br>",
                          "Percent of Total: ", percent, "%", "<br>")) %>%
  add_bars() %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Apal Genotypes"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Observations"),
        title = "Distribution of Observations") %>%
  hide_legend()


# Creating aggregate portfolio by geno.
apal.port.agg <- apal.port %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarize(avg_health = mean(weighted_health),
            avg_mortality = mean(mortality_rate),
            avg_returns = mean(returns),
            sd = sd(returns),
            observations = n())

```

<br>

The chart below shows the relationship between average return and standard deviation.

<br>

```{r apal portolio return vs sd }

plot_ly(apal.port.agg, x = ~sd, 
                      y = ~avg_returns, 
                      color = ~factor(geno),
                      hoverinfo = "text", 
                      text = ~paste0("Geno: ", geno, "<br>",
                                     "Observations: ", observations, "<br>",
                                    "Average Return: ", round(avg_returns,3), "<br>",
                                    "Standard Deviation: ", round(sd, 3))) %>%
                    add_markers(size = ~observations) %>%
                    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Standard Deviation"),
                           yaxis = list(title = "Average Returns"),
                           title = "How Risk and Return Are Related") %>%
                    hide_legend()

# Reviewing distribution of returns for each geno with trelliscope.
# apal.port %>% ggplot(aes(x = returns)) + geom_histogram() + facet_trelliscope(~geno)

```

<br>

#### Apal Bootstrapping

Again, via the Central Limit Theorem, the bootstrapped data approaches a more normal distribution.  Thus, the average returns closely resemble the sample means, but the risk factors (standard deviations) used for portfolio analysis are more closely representative of the population.

<br>

```{r apal bootstrapping portfolio}

# Creating bootstrap data set.
apal.boot <- replicate(n = 1000, simplify = FALSE, expr = {
  apal.port %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 1, replace = TRUE)
 }) %>%
  bind_rows()

# Summarizing bootstrapped data by geno.
apal.boot.agg <- apal.boot %>%
  summarize(avg_health = mean(weighted_health),
         avg_mortality = mean(mortality_rate),
         avg_returns = mean(returns),
         sd = sd(returns),
         observations = n())

```


**Summary of Raw Data**
```{r apal portfolio raw table}
# Raw data summary
print(summary(apal.port.agg[,4:6]))

```

**Summary of Bootstrapped Data**
```{r apal portfolio bootstrap table}

summary(apal.boot.agg[,4:6])

# Checking for normal distribution.
#apal.boot %>% ggplot(aes(x = returns)) + geom_histogram() + facet_trelliscope(~geno)
  
```
<br>
#### Apal Portfolio

The same portfolio constraints and objectives are used for the Apal data.  
<br>

```{r apal portfolio analysis}

#Number of unique genos
#length(unique(apal.port$geno))

apal.returns.wide <- apal.boot %>%
  select(geno, returns) %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = geno, values_from = returns) %>%
  select(-row)

apal.returns.wide <- as.ts(apal.returns.wide)
port_spec <- portfolio.spec(assets = colnames(apal.returns.wide))
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "full_investment")
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "long_only")
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "return", name = "mean")
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "risk", name = "StdDev")
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "box",
                                  min = 0.01, max = 0.25, 
                                  indexnum = 2)

set.seed(2)
apal.opt <- optimize.portfolio(apal.returns.wide,
                          portfolio = port_spec,
                          optimize_method = "random",
                          search_size = 20000,
                          trace = TRUE)

chart.RiskReward(apal.opt, risk.col = "StdDev", return.col = "mean", chart.assets = FALSE,

```


## Conclusions
